2.0.1 -- 2012-09-17
	* lib/Netaudit/SNMP:
	Having constant Mouse attributes were cumbersome. They are now 
	regular globals.  

2.0 -- 2012-09-12
	* lib/NetAudit/SNMP, lib/Netaudit/Plugin/*:
	- N::SNMP do only handle IETF MIBs, all vendor specific code is handled 
	  by the Plugin code.
	- Harmonized the N::SNMP and N::Plugin::* sub names with the database 
	  tables, i.e renamed interfaces -> interface, 
	  isis_neighbours -> isis_neighbour etc.
	- In the PWE3 audit, the peer IP-address is now resolved to hostname

	* lib/Netaudit/Plugin/*:

	  scalars which leads to much nicer for/when code segments. The
	  downside is the split of RegExp and when to two distant places
	  in the code.
