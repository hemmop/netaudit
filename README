netaudit is a tool for doing audits of a network of MPLS-routers. The
audit is done by running a series of "show commands" and walks of
SNMP-tables to gather information of the current status of the devices.
The collected information from two runs can be compared and the
differences output.

The main use of the tool is to take a snapshot of the status of a
network before, for example a software upgrade, and to run a diff
afterwards. If there is a lot of changes in the network if could be a
indication of something have gone bad (in the upgrade).

The data is stored in a SQLite3 database and can be viewed either with 
direct SQL queries, or (recommended) the tool "netreport" included in 
the distribution.
