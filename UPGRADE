netaudit version 2.1 introduce two changes in database storage:

1) In isis_topology, LSP-id's are now stripped from "host" on all platforms

2) In pwe3, the "peer" IP-address is resolved to a hostname

Both changes leads to false positives when running netreport in "diff"
mode. The distribution includes a script share/upgrade1.x-2.1 which converts
old formats to the now ones.


There is some changes in the command line arguments in netreport. See
the man page for further information.
