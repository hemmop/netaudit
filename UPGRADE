netaudit version 2.0 introduce two changes in database storage:

1) In isis_topology, LSP-id's are now stripped from "host" on all platforms

2) In pwe3, the "peer" IP-address is resolved to a hostname

Both changes leads to false positivs when running netreport in "compare"
mode. The distribution includes a script share/upgrade10-20 which converts
old formats to the now ones.
